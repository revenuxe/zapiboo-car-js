  [
    "Age and Kilometres Driven",
    "Registration year and distance travelled give context to how a vehicle has been used. Mileage is considered alongside maintenance and condition, rather than in isolation. A lightly used car and a regularly driven, carefully maintained car can each need a different assessment.",

  [
    "Overall Vehicle Condition",
    "Mechanical health, bodywork, interior wear, tyres and working features all contribute to an inspection. Tell the team about known faults, accident repairs or modifications upfront. An accurate description makes it easier to discuss an offer that reflects the car being inspected.",

  [
    "Ownership and Service History",
    "Previous ownership and documented maintenance help explain your car's history. Service invoices can show what work was completed and when. If records are incomplete, share what you do have and be clear about any gaps rather than guessing at the vehicle's past.",
  ],
  [
    "Fuel Type and Transmission",
    "Petrol, diesel, CNG, hybrid and electric vehicles have different characteristics. Manual and automatic variants can also attract different demand. For an electric car, available battery-health and warranty information can help the team understand the vehicle more fully during the assessment.",

  ],
  [
    "Will I Get an Instant Price From My Registration Number?",
    "No. The registration form starts your inspection request and carries the number into your booking. It does not perform a registration-database lookup or generate an automatic price. Your car's condition and details need to be reviewed before an offer is discussed.",
  ],
  [
    "What Affects My Used Car's Value?",
    "Make, model, variant, age, mileage, overall condition, service records, ownership history and local demand can all influence an offer. Accurate information and an inspection give a more useful basis for assessment than the original purchase price alone.",

    "Which Documents Should I Prepare?",
    "Keep your registration certificate, insurance information, identification and available service records together. PUC and lender-related documents may also be relevant. The exact requirements depend on your vehicle and transaction, so confirm the checklist before arranging the final handover.",
  ],
  [
    "How Long Does Selling a Car Take?",
    "Timing depends on inspection availability, your vehicle, the offer discussion and document readiness. Ask the team about the expected schedule for your sale. Do not treat an inspection appointment as a guaranteed completion or payment time.",
  ],
  [
    "Should I Repair My Car Before the Inspection?",
    "Clean the vehicle and describe known issues accurately. Before spending on major repairs, discuss whether the work is necessary for your intended sale. Repair costs do not automatically translate into an equal increase in the offer.",
  ],
  [
    "Can I Sell an Older or Out-of-State Car?",
    "Share the age, registration state, condition and available documents when you contact the team. Eligibility and additional transfer steps need to be confirmed for the specific vehicle. A booking request is not a guarantee that every vehicle can be accepted.",

          There is no single price that applies to every used car. Even two vehicles with the same
          model and registration year can receive different offers. Their usage, maintenance,
          specification and current condition may be quite different. A useful valuation considers
          the vehicle you own, alongside the market it is being sold in.

          Your original purchase price is one part of the car's history, but it does not determine
          today's offer. Share accurate details and use the inspection to ask questions about how
          the car has been assessed. These are some of the factors worth understanding before you
          decide.

          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Begin with a clear picture of your vehicle. Write down the exact model, variant, age and
            kilometres driven, and gather any maintenance records you have. Think about the
            condition as it is today, including known issues. This preparation makes the inspection
            conversation more useful and reduces the need to check missing details later.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Next, look beyond a headline price. Understand what the offer covers, what steps remain
            and what is expected of you before handover. A convenient appointment, clear
            communication and an organised document process also matter. Take the opportunity to ask
            questions so you can judge the complete sale arrangement.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            An online request can simplify the start, but selling a physical vehicle still involves
            an assessment and a careful handover. Allow time for those stages. If your plans change,
            speak with the team about your appointment instead of assuming that an initial request
            has already completed the sale.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
            Whether you are moving to another city, replacing your car or reducing the number of
            vehicles at home, you can start with the same straightforward process. Share accurate
            details, arrange an inspection and review the offer. The goal is to give you enough
            clarity to make a decision that works for you.
